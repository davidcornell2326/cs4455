# cs4455
This repo is a collection of projects from my Video Game Design course (CS 4455).
M1 through M4 are just class milestones; we only implemented small parts of them.
"Team Project\Final Project" is the main directory, as it contains the entire Unity project and build for our semester-long project, a 3D third-person shooter called Jello Jam Rampage that we created almost entirely from scratch (some 3rd party models, sounds, textures, and animations were used). I was on a team of 5 students working on our game together.
If you wish to see the project in its entirety in Unity, you can open "Team Project\Final Project" as a project in Unity (version 2021.1.28f1 recommended).
If you wish to play the game, download "Team Project\Final Project\Build\Windows" and, once downloaded, open "Jello Jam Rampage.exe" within that folder. The OSX build currently does not work.
To view a video of the gameplay without having to open/play it yourself, a gameplay video is available at https://youtu.be/aQp6_4p4u08

To see the actual C# programming, navigate to "Team Project\Final Project\Assets\Scripts". Our team implemented every .cs file present. As far as scripts that I implemented personally, I was the only or primary contributor to every script in "Scripts\Enemy" as well as the following scripts: BossFightMovementDisabler, CastleFences, CastleTargets, ContactDamager, CursorLock, FallBossFightTrigger, GameQuitter, JelloDrop, JelloDropTrigger, JelloInventory, MusicPlayer, SceneLoader, SceneReloader, SniperProjectile, UltraJello, and UltraJelloController.
