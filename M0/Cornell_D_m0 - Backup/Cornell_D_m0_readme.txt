Main scene: Minigame

Script changes: I have added jump and sprint capabilities to the ball.
Press L Shift to toggle sprint mode (where the ball rolls faster), and press Space to jump.
These instructions are also present on the game's UI.

Content changes: I added some ramps and platforms that require using the ball's new abilities.
I also added invisible walls to ensure the player cannot leave the play area.
To reach the top of the right ramp, you can simply roll up (in sprint or regular mode).
To reach the top of the left ramp, you must jump the ball onto the top left platform and then use sprint mode to get up the steeper slope.
As in the tutorial, getting all pickups results in a win message being displayed (however, in my code, the number of pickups is determined by the code, not hardcoded).
